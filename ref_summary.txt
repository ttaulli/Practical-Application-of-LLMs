The narrator, suffering from “nervous depression,” is confined to a nursery by her husband John, who prescribes rest. Isolated and forbidden to work, she becomes obsessed with the room’s yellow wallpaper, noticing its disturbing pattern. Over time, she imagines a woman trapped behind the design and believes she must free her. In a climactic breakdown, she tears down the wallpaper, declares she has escaped, and creeps over her fainted husband.
